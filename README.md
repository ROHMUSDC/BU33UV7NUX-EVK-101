# BU33UV7NUX-EVK-101 Design Resource Repository
* Hardware Design Files and Documentation for the ROHM BU33UV7NUX-EVK-101 EVK

----
### Description: 
* The BU33UV7NUX converter provides a power supply solution for products powered by two-cell alkaline, NiCd, NiMH, one-cell Li-ion, or Li-polymer batteries. 
* Output currents can go as high as 500mA while using two alkaline, with discharge going down to 1.8V. 
* The BU33UV7NUX includes a reset circuit. (Reset-Detect Voltage: 1.5V, Reset-Release Voltage: 1.9V) 
* The output voltage is fixed by an internal resistor divider. 
* When the VIN voltage is higher than 3.3V, Vout matches Vin.
